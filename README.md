# Olive groves test

A farmer wants to understand the distribution of olive types their land currently holds. There is some data available: `olive_stats`.json that needs to be graphically represented with a histogram (bar chart).

We want to look at the frequency distribution of each property available in the data set. 

The master branch has an app with a dropdown menu (as required), while the main has a carousel display (for aesthetics).
